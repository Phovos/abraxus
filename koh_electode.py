# Miniaturized Electrolysis Cell Simulation
This script simulates the operation of a miniaturized electrolysis cell designed to produce hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases from water (H2O) using a KOH (potassium hydroxide) molar solution as the electrolyte. The system is controlled via a PID loop to ensure the desired rate of gas production.

## Key Assumptions
1. The electrolysis cell has an optimal geometry/design to create the correct size gas bubble with the appropriate surface area.
2. Water is input through a valve, and the exact molar quantity of water is maintained to facilitate efficient electrolysis.
3. The system uses a MOSFET-like sealed circuit with an electrode submerged in the H2O KOH molar solution.
4. The electrode is driven by a controlled current, and the resulting gases are output through one-way valves.
5. The system operates in a PID loop to adjust the current based on the desired and actual rates of hydrogen production.

## Components
1. **Electrode**: Submerged in H2O KOH molar solution, driven by current.
2. **Collector**: Collects and ejects the gases produced.
3. **Working Fluid**: H2O with a set amount of KOH.
4. **Valves**: One-way water input valve and two one-way gas output valves for H2 and O2.

## Control Logic
The PID loop adjusts the current to maintain the desired rate of hydrogen production. The main loop includes:
- Measuring the current rate of H2 production.
- Adjusting the current based on the PID control.
- Checking safety parameters (pressure, temperature, electrolyte level).
